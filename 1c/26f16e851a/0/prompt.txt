can you explore and understand what slopguard is all about. the readme and src should be sufficient

i think it'd be cool to have a slop-guard skill; a skill you use to call slopguard on files or whatever we're writing and refine it with the output from slopguard

can you create the .claude/skills md

also how do we add it to the marketplace? e.g. how do we add a skill + binary to the plugin marketplace?

---

makes senes; can we add the claude plugin instructions to the readme and necssary files

additionally just name the marketplace slop-guard, same as the tool name

and include my site, nwyin.com

and re install instructions, just include a note about using rust and install from crates.io, and if they don't have rust ask permission to install rustup then install the crate

e.g. curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

---

ok wait do we need to have 2 copy of the skills file? can we just remove the one at root  (e.g. .claude)

---

sick let's commit the skill; no need to release

---

wait let's call the skill slop-guard

---

push it

yes, also tag a minor release with a bug fix? or should this just be an increment in the smallest number for semver
